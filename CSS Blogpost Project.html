        <h1>Stone Kirby</h1>
        <h2>Stone Kirby is created when Kirby uses his copy ability and swallows a rock. From there, he is able to turn
            into a rock and deflect anything that comes his way. He can also turn into a rock at anytime meaning he can
            attack enemies while mid-air as he turns into a rock. It's actually insane dude. Like mid-air he goes BONK
            and drops down on his opponents. Actually feels bad dude. That is more toxic than Chernobyl just dropping
            down on your enemies. ESPECIALLY THE KING DEDEDE goons. They didn't ever sign up or BELIEVE there's a pink
            circle just eating things.</h2>

        <h1>Sword Kirby</h1>
        <h2>Sword Kirby is lowkey a chad but I don't mess with him like that. Dudes who require OUTSIDE WEAPONS AND
            ABILITIES are WEAKLINGS. Stone Kirby has his body and his ability that's chadlike. But whatever Sword Kirby
            got different types of swords that have different abilities along with it. Things such as the Ultra Sword
            and Rainbow Sword grant him power ups to his regular sword and sword fighting abilities. BUT WEAPONS ARE FOR
            LOSERS MAN STONE KIRBY IS CHAD.</h2>

        <h1>Parasol Kirby</h1>
        <h2>Parasol Kirby is GODTIER BUT SO SLEPT ON. His description on Kirby Fandom say's he is "harmless looking" BUT
            THAT'S CAP. HE IS SO BADASS AND DESTRUCTIVE. He can swing his umbrella back and forth in front of him. And
            when he goes down from a high place, the parasol slows down his fall super cool stuff.</h2>
